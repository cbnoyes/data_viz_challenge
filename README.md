# data_viz_challenge

I attempted to follow the directions of the challenge to the best of my abilities, mostly through the use of groupbys, summary statistics, pandas, and matplotlib

Finding the duplicate mouse and deleting it was done with the help of a tutor, as well as the boxplots section.

Unfortunately, I ran out of time and was not able to finish the entire assignment. Will do better next time!
